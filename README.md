# StarJDK 21 (jdk21-vista) - Fork of OpenJDK 21 for Vista
Only LTS versions will get backported unless there is reason given (Ex. a popular block game updates JRE versions)

### Why is it called StarJDK?
Well my github usernames is WindClan, my username on everything else is Featherwhisker/Featherwhisker2, my profile picture is TallStar,
naming something after StarClan is fitting

# Welcome to the JDK!
